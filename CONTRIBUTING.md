# Contribution guidelines üîê

**Hello contributors, I want you to stick to the below-listed contribution guidelines. Happy contributing.**

<br/>

- Issues will be assigned on a **First-Come-First-Serve** basis and are applicable only when they have opted through GitHub.
- If a contributor is unable to solve the allotted issue, the issue needs to be passed to other contenders at the discretion of the maintainer/owner.


## General  

- `Fork` the repo to your account.
- `git clone` to clone the repo

- Making a branch is **optional**, else contribute to the main branch of your forked repo.


## After changes : 
- Make sure you do `git pull` to pull the latest version of the code
- `git add .` to stage for commits
- `git commit -am <your message here>` for committing the code.
- **NOTICE: Message will be :** 
    - `fix: <anything you fixed>` 
    - `feat : <any features you added>` 
    - `docs : <any documentation you added>`  
    - `chore : <any chore you did>`


  <br/>

- Then create a Pull Request and wait for review.
- Put up a good pull request title relevant to the issue you are solving. Example `Feat: Search Bar Story added`
- Don't forget to attach **`Screenshots, Proper Description and Issue Number`**
- Remember to be respectful to other contributors, mentors, community
- Don't raise invalid/spam issues they will be closed !!
